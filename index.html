        <p>Goldendoodle weight, height and coat color can vary widely. While Goldendoodles often share their Golden Retriever parent’s signature golden fur, their coats can also come in colors ranging from white to black to brindle, with textures ranging from curly to fluffy. Though their size and appearance can differ, Goldendoodles are nearly universal in sharing a happy, affectionate personality marked by playfulness, intelligence and athleticism. Learn more about the beautiful, friendly Goldendoodle crossbreed and why so many pet parents love bringing them into their homes.</p>
        <p>The Goldendoodle temperament is one of their most compelling traits, as the sunny disposition of a Golden Retriever and the intelligence of a Poodle meet in this crossbreed. Goldendoodles are as active and energetic as both parent breeds and tend to exhibit the skillful agility of Poodles. But they also have a style all their own, as Goldendoodle size, coloring and coat texture can vary dramatically from one dog to the next.</p>

        <p>Like all dogs, Goldendoodles are most likely to thrive on a balanced diet that is nutritionally dense with high-quality protein, fat and easily digestible carbohydrates. Because of their active nature, Goldendoodles—especially large-sized ones—may need additional joint support in the form of food or supplements that contain glucosamine, chondroitin, MSM or fish oil. Always make sure that whatever dog food you give your Goldendoodle is appropriate for their age, size and activity level. Because Goldendoodle weight issues can arise when these dogs don’t get as much activity as they require, be careful not to overfeed or under-exercise your dog.</p>
        <p>From nutritious food and dog treats to bones and teething toys, Petco has a range of delicious goodies that you can feel as good about giving to your Goldendoodle as your dog will about tasting them.</p>

        <p>The Goldendoodle has the winning personality, temperament and specific needs common among many members of this crossbreed. However, the variances that can occur from one Goldendoodle to another—including size, coat texture and favorite activities—means that the list of Goldendoodle supplies commonly needed by pet parents can also vary. At Petco, we can help you decide which Goldendoodle puppy supplies your special pet needs as you get your home ready for a new dog.</p>
        <p class="supplies-sub-heading">Beds & Toys</p>
        <p>Active dogs like Goldendoodles often benefit from extra joint support. Along with vitamins and supplements, another beneficial form of support can come from specially constructed bedding. An orthopedic dog bed can help relieve stress and pressure from your Goldendoodle’s hips and joints while helping them get a good night’s sleep.</p>
        <p>Sometimes the fun things still count as essential Goldendoodle accessories. Toys can help your dog get the recommended amount of daily exercise, relieve boredom and anxiety and facilitate enrichment and mental stimulation. At Petco, we have an assortment of fun toys to help your Goldendoodle accomplish all these goals. Make sure you choose a toy that’s the recommended size for your dog.</p>

        <p>Flea & tick solutions are some of the best things for Goldendoodles you can ever buy, as pest prevention is crucial for your dog’s health in both the short and long term. Fleas & ticks are incredibly irritating and uncomfortable for pets—and stressful for their parents—but they can also carry potentially deadly diseases and spread them to your Goldendoodle. Make sure flea & tick control solutions are on your new Goldendoodle puppy checklist and be diligent about using them as directed throughout your dog’s life. </p>
        <p>Because a quality diet is foundational to your pet’s wellbeing, food and supplements that support your dog’s body with real nutrition are among the best Goldendoodle products you can buy. Naturally active pups may benefit greatly from supplements formulated with glucosamine and omegas for hip and joint support. A probiotic to ease potential digestive issues is another popular choice. There are even supplemental soft chews made with ingredients known to help calm dogs who experience anxiety—a good option if you have a nervous Goldendoodle. </p>

        <p>A Goldendoodle’s signature wavy coat—typically somewhere between the tight curl of a Poodle and the fluff of a Golden Retriever—is good at holding more than just our attention. It can trap moisture easily and keep your dog damp, which can be uncomfortable for your dog and bad news for your furniture. Waterproof Goldendoodle accessories can shield your dog from getting sopping wet on walks in rainy weather. A reflective vest can also help drivers and bikers see your dog better on overcast days. </p>

        <p>Grooming your pup is an important task that you can do yourself if you have the right tools. As part of their grooming routine, always check your pup's teeth. Your Goldendoodle’s dental health is just as important as yours, but you can’t use human oral hygiene solutions when caring for your dog’s teeth. Toothbrushes and toothpaste designed for canines should always be on hand in your collection of Goldendoodle stuff. You can even add a dental health liquid to your dog’s water dish for extra support between brushings. </p>

      <section id="Training" class="main-section">
        <header>Training</header>
        <p>Some dog breeds are known to be stubborn and more difficult to train, but not the Golden Retriever or the Poodle—and not their adorable offspring, the Goldendoodle. In fact, Goldendoodles are typically naturally responsive and adaptable. Goldendoodle training can help promote clear communication, and because Goldendoodles are eager learners, they can quickly pick up on training cues. Goldendoodles also have a deep drive to please their favorite people, providing them with motivation to do a good job and win your praise.</p>
        <p>Goldendoodle training is essential at a young age. Like any puppy, they’re full of energy—and that mischievous, stubborn Golden Retriever streak may make an appearance. Here are some tips on how to train a Goldendoodle.    </p>
        <p class="training-sub-heading">Training sessions are for everyone</p>
        <p>When it comes to training your Goldendoodle puppy, remember that you’re teaching your entire household how to be pet parents as well. Most Goldendoodles are intelligent and eager to learn, but if they’re getting mixed messages from different people, they’ll get confused.  </p>
        <p>Make sure everyone is on the same page and knows the right training cues and hand signals to communicate with your pet. It can be very tempting for visitors and younger family members to indulge your cute puppy and encourage undesired behaviors, but this can hinder the puppy’s progress.</p>
        <p>You should always use positive reinforcement during Goldendoodle puppy training. After a long day, it can be easy to get frustrated or shout when they don’t listen or have an accident on the carpet. However, these techniques can negatively impact their mental health and likely decrease the trust they have placed in you. You want to strengthen your bond with your puppy while training, and positive reinforcement is widely recognized as the most effective and ethical way to do this.</p>
        <p class="training-sub-heading">Crate training can benefit you and your dog</p>
        <p>Goldendoodle crate training can be a great training solution when your puppy is still learning. It helps with potty training—many dogs will instinctively avoid going in their crate—and it gives them a secure area of their own to rest when they’re tired or stressed. It also helps protect them from wandering around and hurting themselves in the middle of the night when you’re sleeping. Providing a secure place for your pup to rest and relax can be the first sign of trust that establishes the cornerstone for later training.</p>
        <p>The key is to make their crate a happy place. You should neverforce your puppy into their crate—instead, lure them with treats and let the experience be voluntary. If you turn crate time into a positive, you will find that they’ll start heading to their crate on their own when they’re sleepy or need a break.</p>
        <p>Never leave your puppy in their crate for an extended period. Remember, your pup will try to avoid going to the bathroom in their crate—a crucial part of Goldendoodle potty training. You also shouldn’t use the crate as a place for timeouts or punishment, as your dog will start forming negative associations with it.</p>
        <p>A good guideline for crate time is taking your dog’s age in months and adding one—this is the maximum number of hours they should be left in the crate at a time. For example, if your dog is six months old, they should only be in the crate for a maximum of seven hours. It may be difficult waking up in the middle of the night to let your puppy go pee, but Goldendoodle puppy training is a lot like raising a toddler—it takes patience and time.</p>
        <p class="training-sub-heading">Consistency is the key to Goldendoodle potty training</p>
        <p>Puppy potty training is something you want to accomplish sooner rather than later, but every dog is different. Here are some tips when you’re first learning.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Take them out immediately after eating, drinking or upon waking </li>
          <li>Take them out to the same spot every time</li>
          <li>Don’t scold your pet if they have an accident—clean up and move on</li>
          <li>Provide praise and reward them with dog treats when they go outside or ask to go—and as soon as they go potty</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When figuring out how to potty train a Goldendoodle puppy, patience and consistency are key factors. It’s also important to remember your pup has a tiny little bladder—taking them outside as frequently as possible will help prevent accidents. Eventually, they’ll get the hang of it.</p>

        <header>Health</header>
        <p>Are you thinking of bringing a Goldendoodle home? This hybrid breed has great qualities that make them a wonderful addition to many different types of families. Another positive aspect of this breed is that major health issues with Goldendoodles are not as common as some other breeds. As a hybrid between a Golden Retriever and a Poodle, Goldendoodles can have less risk of breed-related health issues compared to some pure breeds. In fact, the life expectancy of a Goldendoodle is an impressive 10 to 15 years.</p>
        <p>This isn’t to say that Goldendoodle health issues are non-existent. Goldendoodles are still at risk of some of the same illnesses and hereditary conditions seen in Golden Retrievers and Poodles. As you begin your adoption journey, it’s important to be aware of Goldendoodles’ common health issues so you can do your research and ask breeders, rescue organizations or shelters the right questions.</p>

        <header>Grooming</header>
        <p>Since there is no recognized breed standard for Goldendoodle weight, size, color or coat texture, there are many different coat types for Goldendoodles to be found. Some have curly, longer coats more similar to those of a Poodle, while others can be shorter, thicker and possibly double-coated to more closely resemble Golden Retrievers. Add the whole range of Goldendoodle haircuts pet parents give their dogs and you’ll find that no two Goldendoodles look exactly alike.</p>
        <p>What is a Goldendoodle trait nearly all these diverse dogs have in common? Their tendency not to be big shedders like a Golden Retriever. In fact, some Goldendoodles shed so little that they’re often referred to as non-shedding dogs—losing hair sparsely and infrequently in a manner more similar to their Poodle parents.</p>

            <div>
              <p class="grooming-heading">Brushing</p>
              <p>About once a week, use a slicker brush to gently comb out your Goldendoodle’s coat. This will not only help keep their coat from becoming matted, but it will also help remove any stray hairs before they end up on your clothes and couch. Brushing also removes debris that may be stuck in your Goldendoodle’s fur, including leaves, dirt, burrs, bugs and other potential irritants—which is especially important if your Goldendoodle experiences dermatitis.</p>
              <p>For those Goldendoodles that will require regular grooming—or even those that are losing some coat—utilize Petco’s professional grooming services and talk with a pet stylist about the best options for your dog’s specific coat variety.</p>

            <div>
              <p class="grooming-heading">Bathing</p>
              <p>Because a love of swimming is often part of the Goldendoodle temperament, your dog may not be as averse to bath time as some breeds. Even so, it’s not usually necessary to bathe your Goldendoodle more frequently than once per month, especially since too many baths can dry out their sensitive skin. If your Goldendoodle has skin allergies, sebaceous adenitis or another condition that makes their epidermis irritated, your veterinarian may recommend a medicated shampoo to help soothe their skin and quell itching. </p>

            <div>
              <p class="grooming-heading">Nail Trimming</p>
              <p>Most Goldendoodles are easygoing and eager to please their pet parents, making even potentially difficult chores like nail trimming a relatively stress-free experience. Take a paw securely in your hand while your dog is sitting still and trim each nail at a 45-degree angle, avoiding the tender pink quick. Make sure to give your Goldendoodle clear cues and reward their patience with plenty of love and affirmation. Your Goldendoodle will be less likely to become agitated if you project calm instead of tension. </p>

              <p class="grooming-heading">Teeth Brushing & Dental Treats</p>
              <p>Even dogs can develop plaque, tartar and oral infections. Every pet should have a daily dental routine, as regular toothbrushing can help prevent oral and dental problems from developing and can also help you spot potential issues. A full-grown Goldendoodle should have their teeth brushed at home daily—or at minimum 2 or 3 times per week—with a dog-safe toothbrush and toothpaste. Unlike human toothpaste that typically has a minty or fresh flavor—and can be toxic to dogs—dog toothpaste is made with the savory, meaty flavors that they enjoy. In addition to home toothbrushing, you should take your dog in for a professional veterinary dental cleaning at least once a year.</p>
              <p>Toothbrushing isn’t the only way you can care for your dog’s teeth and gums at home between dental cleanings. Dental treats that help scrape away plaque and tartar aren’t just beneficial for your Goldendoodle’s dental health—they’re also entertaining and enjoyable for your dog. These types of treats and chews are made from materials that are safe for your Goldendoodle’s mouth, and they gently scrape the teeth and gums as your dog chews them. Just remember that your Goldendoodle’s size determines what size treats they should be given. Treats that are too big or small can present a choking hazard or harm your dog’s mouth and digestive tract—always check the size guidelines of any dental treat you want to give your Goldendoodle.  </p>

        <header>Where to Adopt</header>
        <p class="spacing-bottom">Even though Goldendoodles aren’t recognized as an official dog breed, their distinct admirable qualities keep pet parents consistently eager to seek them out as a family addition. The reasons for this enthusiasm are almost too numerous to list. The Goldendoodle temperament is a blend of a Poodle’s athleticism and intelligence with a Golden Retriever’s energy and loyalty. Goldendoodles tend to be great with both kids and other pets, and their easygoing attitude adapts well to a variety of circumstances.</p>  
        <p class="spacing">Goldendoodles inherit their love—and need—for ample exercise from both their dog parents. It’s important to make sure your Goldendoodle gets a minimum of 30 minutes of vigorous exercise a day—and don’t be surprised if they want more.</p>  
        <p class="spacing-top">Since Goldendoodles are a crossbreed, there is no “breed standard” for size, color or coat length and texture. Goldendoodle weight can vary from a miniature dog that weighs under 20 lbs. all the way up to 90 lbs.—even bigger than a Standard Poodle. Goldendoodle coats come in a veritable rainbow of colors—from solid gold, white, black or brown to brindle, merle and tri-color patterns. Some Goldendoodles have a shorter, thicker coat like a Golden Retriever, while others have a longer coat like the Poodle—and some will be a mixture of both. All coat varieties require regular brushing to help with any shedding and to keep their coats from matting. For those with coats that grow like a Poodle, they typically require regular grooming to maintain an optimum length.</p>
        <p>Amid all this variety, what tends to remain constant is the Goldendoodle’s sunny personality and friendly nature. While pet parents have a vast array of attributes to choose from when they’re looking for the perfect pet to share their home, many find that it’s the famous Goldendoodle temperament—more than any custom physical characteristic—that wins them over. And since the Goldendoodle life span can reach up to 15 years, it’s conceivable that you’ll be able to enjoy up to a decade and a half of fun with your good-natured Goldendoodle. Whether you want to adopt your Goldendoodle fully grown or as a puppy, Petco and Petco Love can help you navigate the process to find your scruffy soulmate. </p>
